Instructions on how to play.

there are 3 types of interactable objects in the game:

- Levers: when pulled up or down will change the weather of the game. each lever changes a different
statistic paramater. Each paramater affects the weather.

- Globe: click and drag to spin the globe of the world around.

- Buttons: when pressed will change the weather. The current presets are currently 
based on loose approximations of Houston and New York City's average weather parameters. 

with mouse and keyboard there is also fully functional FPS movement that use WASD to move.

Press E to open the pause menu and press W or A to change selectable buttons and spacebar to select an 
option. selecting back will take you back into the game's main UI and selecting quit will quit the game.

start menu buttons will be selected with the mouse. start will load the simulation, credits will take you
to the credits section and the quit button will quit the game.

VR instructions:

Game cannot be played from the start menu. Menu requires mouse to operate and cannot operate with controller
because didn't have enough time to debug the menu navigation system. 

In build settings remove the start menu and add the Climate Sim scene. Game can be played in VR and regular builds from there.

Similar issues with the pause menu. Same as the start menu, the selection system will press both buttons at the same time. 
spent two days trying to fix this but ran out of time.

movement does not work in VR but selection and camera movement does so simulation is playable in VR.
